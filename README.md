Often teams try to coordinate the timings for the meetings and this usually takes a long time and at last many are left to
discontent but not anymore 

With the CollegeSpace app you can post the time your free at and if more people are free at that time then that time gets an 
automatic upvote and that time is selected for the meeting.

Its a step to increase the communication and transpirancy amongst all without anymore fuzz.

Pods implemented are:
    pod 'Firebase'
    pod 'Firebase/Core'
    pod 'Firebase/Auth'
    pod 'Firebase/Database'
    pod 'Firebase/Storage'
    pod 'SwiftKeychainWrapper'


some other pods you can implement to add google sign in as well as the facebook sign in are:
    pod 'GoogleSignIn'
    pod 'FBSDKLoginKit'
    pod 'FacebookCore'
    
    you can edit your time at which you were previously free but not anymore but simply deleting the previous one and then
    adding a new time.
    
    Design and layout combination gives a sensational look to the app
